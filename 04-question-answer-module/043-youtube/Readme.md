# Program Documentation: AI-Driven Question Answering System for YouTube Videos

This Python program showcases the implementation of an AI-driven question-answering system tailored for analyzing YouTube videos. The program utilizes various components from the `langchain` library to process video content, extract information, and provide context-aware responses to user queries. Below is an overview of the key functionalities and components of the program:

## Overview

The program leverages modules from the `langchain` library to extract data from YouTube videos, process text content, and generate AI-driven responses to user questions. It demonstrates the integration of text processing, embeddings, and retrieval techniques to enhance question-answering capabilities.

## Components and Functionalities

### Environment Setup

- The program loads necessary environment variables using the `dotenv` library.
- It initializes a chat model using `ChatOpenAI` and `OpenAIEmbeddings` for handling user queries.

### YouTube Video Processing

- The program fetches metadata and content from specified YouTube video URLs using the `YoutubeLoader` module.
- Additional metadata, such as the publish year of the videos, is extracted and associated with the documents.

### Text Processing and Embedding Generation

- Text content from videos is split into manageable chunks using a recursive character text splitter.
- OpenAI embeddings are utilized to generate embeddings for the text chunks.

### Document Retrieval and Question Answering

- Document embeddings are stored in a vector store named `Chroma` for efficient retrieval.
- A retriever is created to fetch relevant documents based on query embeddings.

### Question Contextualization and Answering

- The program handles contextual question reformulation to ensure questions are independent of prior context.
- A question-answering model is used to generate concise answers to user queries based on the retrieved information.

### User Interaction

- The program implements an interactive chat system where users can input questions related to the YouTube video content.
- The chat system maintains a chat history to provide context for answering subsequent questions.

## Usage

To run the program:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed, and the `.env` file is configured with necessary settings.
2. Execute the script in an environment where the `langchain` library and its dependencies are available.
3. Interact with the system by entering questions related to the YouTube video content and receiving AI-generated answers.

## Educational Purpose

This documentation serves as an educational resource for understanding the concepts and implementation of an AI-driven question-answering system tailored for YouTube videos. It highlights the use of AI models and text processing techniques to analyze video content and provide informative responses to user queries.
