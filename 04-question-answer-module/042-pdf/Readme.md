# Program Documentation: AI-Powered Question Answering System

This Python program demonstrates the implementation of an AI-powered question-answering system using various components from the `langchain` library. The program showcases the integration of text processing, document loading, embedding generation, and retrieval-based question answering functionalities. Below is an overview of the key components and functionalities of the program:

## Overview

The program leverages modules from the `langchain` library to create an interactive chat system that can provide context-aware responses to user queries. It utilizes advanced AI models and techniques to process user questions and retrieve relevant information from loaded documents.

## Components and Functionalities

### Environment Setup

- The program loads necessary environment variables using the `dotenv` library.
- It initializes OpenAI embeddings and sets up a chat model for handling user queries.

### Text Processing and Document Loading

- A text splitter is initialized to divide text into manageable chunks based on specified parameters.
- PDF documents are loaded using the `PyPDFLoader` module and split into smaller sections for processing.

### Document Embedding and Retrieval

- Document embeddings are generated using OpenAI embeddings and stored in a vector store named `Chroma`.
- A retriever is created to fetch relevant documents based on query embeddings.

### Question Answering System

- The program handles contextual question reformulation to ensure questions are understandable without prior context.
- A question-answering model is used to generate concise answers to user queries based on the retrieved information.

### User Interaction

- The program implements an interactive chat system where users can input questions and receive AI-generated responses.
- The chat system maintains a chat history to provide context for answering subsequent questions.

## Usage

To run the program:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed, and the `.env` file is configured with necessary settings.
2. Execute the script in an environment where the `langchain` library and its dependencies are available.
3. Interact with the system by entering questions and receiving AI-generated answers.

## Educational Purpose

This documentation serves as an educational resource for understanding the concepts and implementation of an AI-powered question-answering system. It demonstrates the integration of text processing, AI models, and document retrieval techniques to build an interactive and intelligent chat system.
